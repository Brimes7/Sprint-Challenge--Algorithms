#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) The while loop will run a 0(n) so bam it is the O(n)


b) O(n^2) the for loop makes it an O(n) as does the while loop and combining the 2 gets you your answer


c) Nice try you almost got me but it is still O(n)

## Exercise II

```Suppose that you have an n-story building and plenty of eggs. 
Suppose also that an egg gets broken if it is thrown off 
floor f or higher, and doesn't get broken if dropped off 
a floor less than floor f. Devise a strategy to determine 
the value of f such that the number of dropped + broken 
eggs is minimized.

Write out your proposed algorithm in plain English or 
pseudocode AND give the runtime complexity of your solution.```

ANSWER: Start at floor 1 drop the egg if it breaks start over and if 
it doesnt break move on to the next one recursively.
